# [1] I have this instead of desktop icon because trying to avoid installing anything
# using root (boss) account. For boss account, just install from official Debian repo.
# Proper VSCode installation requires adding a Microsoft repo, similar to how Chrome
# does it. That makes my system harder to reason about. Hence I "installed" VSCode
# using official tar gz download which I just unzipped to ~/Desktop. Similar to how
# Jetbrains IDEs do it.

# Chrome installed this way doesn't seem to be able to update, so need to repeat every
# so often. Also not sure if any security implications.
# TO INSTALL
# download the deb file, then `dpkg -x google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb .`
# That will extract usr var and opt dirs. Move those to ~/opt/chrome-stable or wherever
# you put it, which will overwrite previous version. History and other data are fine
# since those are elsewhere.
