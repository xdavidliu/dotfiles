# usage: create simlink ~/.inputrc to this file, and bash automatically reads it
# see: READLINE section in man bash

# note you can get the key sequence chars by doing cat >> ~/.inputrc,
# then ctrl-V to quoted insert, then ctrl-C to end the cat.

# shift-tab
"[Z": shell-expand-line

# originally just transposes character
"\C-t": edit-and-execute-command

# note that C-M-e is by default shell-expand-line, and there is also
# alias-expand-line and history-and-alias-expand-line.

# I wanted shift-space but that is all but impossible! Apparently in xterm
# you can do it, but would have to first map shift-space to some other symbol
# in .Xresources, then map that symbol to some bash function that does
# alias-expand-line then self-insert space here in inputrc
